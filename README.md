# Ptex Management Dashboard

A fully secured, production-grade Timesheet & MIS Management System for **Ptex**, built with **Next.js 14 (App Router) + MySQL + Prisma**.

Two completely isolated portals:

| Portal      | Who can access | Capabilities |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Employee** | `EMPLOYEE` role | Submit / view their own timesheets only |
| **Manager**  | `MANAGER` role  | Full timesheet visibility, sandbox MIS editor, MIS generation, exports |

Employees can never see anything the Manager edits in the sandbox — sandbox data lives in a separate table and is never exposed via the employee API surface.

## Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure your `.env`

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust:

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/ptex_db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="replace-with-32-plus-character-random-string"
AUTH_SECRET="same-as-NEXTAUTH_SECRET"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
AUTH_TRUST_HOST="true"
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
```

### 3. Run migrations and seed

```bash
npm run prisma:push     # creates tables in MySQL
npm run prisma:seed     # seeds clients, projects, tasks, demo users
```

### 4. Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> and sign in with one of the demo accounts:

| Role     | Email              | Password    |
|----------|--------------------|-------------|
| Manager  | manager@ptex.com   | Manager@123 |
| Employee | taha@ptex.com      | Taha@123    |

## Key features

### Employee portal
- **Dashboard** with weekly progress (Sat–Fri grid), monthly totals, recent entries
- **New entry** form mirroring the original Excel columns: Date, Client Code, Activity ID, Description, Hours, Type, Beeline Task, Task ID, PO Ref. Auto-derived: Week No., Week Label, Day, Minutes
- **My timesheets** list with edit/submit/delete on drafts only
- DRAFT/SUBMITTED/APPROVED/REJECTED status badges

### Manager portal
- **Dashboard** with KPIs and pending approval queue
- **All Timesheets** with filters (status, client, employee, date range)
- **Detail view** with approve/reject + rejection note
- **Sandbox MIS editor** — clone a date range into a named sandbox, then add/modify/soft-delete rows. Diff tab shows added/modified/removed
- **MIS Generator** — preview by employee, by client, detailed log, and 4 charts (pie, donut, bar by week, bar by employee). Finalize into a permanent MIS report
- **MIS report viewer** with Excel export matching the original sheet columns
- **Employee management** — CRUD with role assignment
- **Clients / Projects / Tasks** — collapsible CRUD tree
- **Settings** — system overview

### Security
- All `/manager/*` and sensitive `/api/*` routes blocked by middleware to `MANAGER` only
- Employee API queries always filtered server-side by `userId === session.user.id`
- Sandbox endpoints are MANAGER-only — sandbox data never reaches employee tokens
- Every mutation writes to the `AuditLog` table
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (configurable rounds)
- Zod validation on all API inputs
